## About Me ##
My name is Derek Martinez. I am 23 years old and have lived in Miami, Florida my whole life. I am currently the digital marketing manager at One Beat Medical & Training. I graduated from Florida State University and am now pursuing a master's degree in digital strategy at the University of Florida. In my free time I enjoy joking around with friends, going to the beach, watching movies, and playing sports. 
## Past Coding Experience ##
While managing e-commerce stores at my job, I gained some very rudimentary coding experiences. I created and edited web pages and product pages using HTML and CSS. I made very slight changes to direct website themes through Shopify Liquid as well as the WooCommerce theme file editor. Additionally, I had to design marketing emails for a period of time using HTML and CSS as the company CRM did not support a graphical editor for marketing emails. 
## Career Goals ##
1. Work for a South Florida sports organization
2. Work for a non-profit organization
3. Start my own business
